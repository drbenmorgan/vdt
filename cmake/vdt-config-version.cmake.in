# - Versioning file for vdt
#
# This enables client projects of vdt to determine the version of
# vdt they found using the find_package command. More importantly, it 
# allows that command to automatically determine whether the detected 
# version is suitable if the client project requested a minimum 
# (or even exact) version of vdt.
